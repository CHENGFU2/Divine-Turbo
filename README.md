# Strm 
## Description
The GPU Turbo tweak claims to increase the phoneâ€™s GPU power by up to 75% but at the same time reduces power consumption by up to 25%

## What it does
This module uses the tool "resetprop" to modify the default values found in build.prop to enhance gpu and accelerates your device performance to the highest level!.

## Requirements
* Magisk v15.0 or higher

## Features
Strm aims to achieve a fair **balance** between **power consumption** and **performance**.
Instead to tuning the parameters manually, Strm adopts Project WIPE open source <code>interactive</code> parameters for all mainstream SOCs that are generated via machine learning <code>AI</code> and can adapt to multiple styles of workload sequences.
This idea is similar to <code>EAS</code>, which takes into account both performance and power consumption costs through power consumption models and workload sequence. But obviously, <code>EAS</code> has a much lower response time and replaces tuning with decision logic.<br><br>In addition, it also includes other parameter tuning, such as <code>HMP scheduler parameters, virtual Memory, GPU, I/O scheduler</code> to unify the rest of the <code>kernel</code> parameters for a more consistent experience.
<br><br>Strm also supports <code>schedutil</code> and <code>schedutil</code> based governos in <code>EAS</code> devices like the Pixel 2/3.

<p>SQ - <b>very universal</b> Android OS optimizer. Very wide-range settings of OS and Linux kernel are configured, still being cross-platform utility, maximally compatible with all devices. This means that it doesn't have any dirty hacks/hard codes and 3rd part binaries (except busybox) & config files. FDE applies configurations depending on its hardware and software, so that in the end every device is configured <b>individually</b>.</p><p>New <i>unique</i> method of execution - all required FDE components are loaded directly to RAM and executed from there. System partitions are remounted RW only once while installation. This means <b>high speed</b> (the worst RAM will have at least ~500MB/s of I/O speed), <b>no power consumption</b> (no NAND memory I/O occurs) and <b>security</b> (system partitions are in read-only state). Also new-gen FDE is synced with OS boot process - so tweaks will be applied in correct time. All system partitions are trimmed and checked for errors after every OS boot with FDE onboard. Universal installer automatically detects what ROOT-method you use and how to autostart. Finally, FDE is not only about optimization. It's also about security and <i>feature-enabler</i>.</p><p align="center">See compacted list of most included features <a href="https://forum.xda-developers.com/showpost.php?p=79092323&postcount=517"><b>HERE</b></a>.<br></p>

<p>As you may notice from the name "Strm" - can tell us that it has a <b>real</b> <code>AI inside</code>. AI will learn how do you use your device, check out current usage scenario and adapt some system parameters real time to give you best usage experience.
