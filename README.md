# Strm 
## Description
The GPU Turbo tweak claims to increase the phoneâ€™s GPU power by up to 75% but at the same time reduces power consumption by up to 25%

## What it does
This module uses the tool "resetprop" to modify the default values found in build.prop to enhance gpu and accelerates your device performance to the highest level!.

## Requirements
* Magisk v15.0 or higher

## Features
Strm aims to achieve a fair **balance** between **power consumption** and **performance**.
Instead to tuning the parameters manually, Strm adopts Project WIPE open source <code>interactive</code> parameters for all mainstream SOCs that are generated via machine learning <code>AI</code> and can adapt to multiple styles of workload sequences.
This idea is similar to <code>EAS</code>, which takes into account both performance and power consumption costs through power consumption models and workload sequence. But obviously, <code>EAS</code> has a much lower response time and replaces tuning with decision logic.<br><br>In addition, it also includes other parameter tuning, such as <code>HMP scheduler parameters, virtual Memory, GPU, I/O scheduler</code> to unify the rest of the <code>kernel</code> parameters for a more consistent experience.
<br><br>Strm also supports <code>schedutil</code> and <code>schedutil</code> based governos in <code>EAS</code> devices like the Pixel 2/3.

## Requirements
- [Magisk](https://github.com/topjohnwu/Magisk/releases) or init.d support if not using magisk
- [Busybox](https://sourceforge.net/projects/magiskfiles/files/module-uploads/busybox-ndk-13015.zip/download) (Needed for terminal commands).


## Changelog 
* v1.0 - Initial Releaase
