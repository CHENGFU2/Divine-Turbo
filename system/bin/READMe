# GPU Turbo Boost
## Description
The GPU Turbo tweak claims to increase the phoneâ€™s GPU power by up to 75% but at the same time reduces power consumption by up to 25%

## What it does
This module uses the tool "resetprop" to modify the default values found in build.prop to:

	dalvik.vm.dexopt-flags=m=y
	debug.sf.hw=1
	debug.composition.type=c2d
	debug.composition.type=gpu
	debug.egl.profiler=1
	debug.egl.hw=1
	debug.enabletr=true
	debug.overlayui.enable=1
	debug.performance.tuning=1
	debug.qc.hardware=true
	debug.qctwa.statusbar=1
	debug.qctwa.preservebuf=1
	debug.sf.hw=1
	dev.pm.dyn_samplingrate=1
	hw3d.force=1
	hwui.render_dirty_regions=false
	hwui.disable_vsync=true
	persist.sampling_profiler=0
	persist.service.pcsync.enable=0
	persist.service.lgospd.enable=0
	persist.sys.composition.type=c2d
	persist.sys.composition.type=gpu
	persist.sys.purgeable_assets=1
	persist.sys.ui.hw=1
	persist.sys.use_16bpp_alpha=1
	persist.sys.NV_FPSLIMIT=60
	persist.sys.NV_POWERMODE=1
	persist.sys.NV_PROFVER=15
	persist.sys.NV_STEREOCTRL=0
	persist.sys.NV_STEREOSEPCHG=0
	persist.sys.NV_STEREOSEP=20
	ro.config.disable.hw_accel=false
	ro.fb.mode=1
	ro.product.gpu.driver=1
	ro.sf.compbypass.enable=0
	ro.vold.umsdirtyratio=20
	video.accelerate.hw=1
#### Instructions

Please follow the instuction below from @axeldna:

1. Removed the installed Wifi Bonding module.
2. Removed all saved wifi 2.4Ghz networks (I removed all of them anyway, but shouldn't be necessary).
3. Rebooted the phone (to make sure wifi settings are removed from cloud account too).
4. Installed the Wifi Bonding module.
5. Rebooted the phone (as indicated by Magisk to start the module).
6. With a phone "free of wifi" and with a fresh Wifi Bonding module, I joined 2.4Ghz wifi networks.
7. Checked my newly registered 2.4Ghz networks and they are showing 150Mbps Link Speed.
8. On some MTK solution AP, they are showing 300Mbps Link Speed.
This module should work on most of the devices. By default, some devices provided an ini file to control the wifi behavior. This module modified the `WCNSS_qcom_cfg.ini` in order to support 40mhz. The basic logic is simple, but not all devices need such kind of module. If you can find `WCNSS_qcom_cfg.ini` in your system partition, please open an issue to report it to me; if you can't, this module won't work for you, including almost all Nexus/Pixel devices.

#### NOTICE
# Android RAM management fixes by crok

## Tweak the memory management of the device, enable more background apps.. et cetera..

```
ro.config.fha_enable=true
ro.sys.fw.bg_apps_limit=32
ro.config.dha_cached_max=16
ro.config.dha_empty_max=42
ro.config.dha_empty_init=32
ro.config.dha_lmk_scale=0.545
ro.config.dha_th_rate=2.3
ro.config.sdha_apps_bg_max=64
ro.config.sdha_apps_bg_min=8
```


*Some tweaks are there only to have a positive effect when another feature will be activated
like agressive LMK is disabled but LMS scaling has been set or vm.swappiness set to 30 but no swap/zRAM by default.*


These can be easily set via other tools or apps that support init.d scripts and build.prop editing but I use Magisk anyway.. so.. why not using it to do the job, properly - with successful SafetyNet test    ( :

These changes are basic/fundamental changes in the behavior of Android system (ActivityManager, etc.) and the Linux kernel (LMK) - thus works on almost anything starting from Android 4+ as far as I can tell you. The only bottleneck is the RAM: I recommend at least 2GB or RAM, it has been tested on 3GB and 4GB with AEX 4.6 and ElectraBlue kernel and MIUI EU Dev ROM. 

[Here](https://drive.google.com/file/d/0B4FApl7433hBNEZtRElUbzRwTkU/view) is a video from a testuser that shows how efficient is the multitasking with the module (no tab reloading in Chrome, no reloading of apps - even though the testuser is using 20+ apps).

*NOTE: If you are using MIUI ROM please disable MIUI optimization and MIUI memory optimization because it resets most of these settings. If you use any app that tweaks settings above please uninstall or at least disable them to run and ruin the module's settings.*

## Requirements
* Magisk v15.0 or higher

## Changelog 
* Initial Release v1.0
